# Electron Example Calculator

## Introduction

ElectronExampleCalculator is an open-source project specifically designed as a practical reference for developers keen on building a calculator-like desktop application using Electron. While the calculations executed by the app are arbitrary and serve no specific real-world use, the focus of the project is to present a clear model of how you can structure and develop your own, fully-functional, Electron-based calculator application.

## Key Components

- __Interactive User Interface:__ The application features a user interface that mimics a typical calculator, complete with input fields, sliders, and radio buttons. This interaction model can serve as a roadmap for your own unique user interface designs.

- __Preload Scripts and Context Bridge:__ ElectronExampleCalculator integrates a preload script in tandem with Electron's context bridge to securely expose certain APIs to the renderer process. This is a core aspect of Electron's security features, and is worth understanding for safe and efficient application development.

- __Functional Code Organization:__ The codebase of the application is partitioned into clearly defined functions and utilities, providing an organized, easy-to-follow structure that developers can easily adapt and expand upon for their projects.

- __Backend Calculations:__ The project simulates backend calculations based on user inputs, presenting a practical example of how frontend and backend can interact in an Electron application.
